                    <p>Website size. These mini-websites are designed to ‘get the attention’ of you potential customers. Within the website there are plenty of opportunities for your customers to link to your main website. Brevity is often the key to getting someone’s attention. It is a lot like reading a resume, if a resume is more than a couple of pages long, they are often set aside and ignored.

                        How it works. Use this to get the attention of your customers. With a few well-placed graphics and select verbiage, you can prompt them to look deeper into your services. All too often when we have a brief encounter with a new contact, the time is too short to make a formal introduction. Sometimes there is just enough time to hand off a card. As you hand your new “Get To Know You” business card include an invitation to visit the site on the back of the card. This is your opportunity to extend the short encounter to share more information about your services.
