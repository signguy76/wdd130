      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Hi. Have you noticed these days that it has become hard to get a proper introduction with potential clients that helps them to know who you are and what you do?
        I work with website development and have found one of the best ways to achieve a proper introduction is by way of an introductory site. With the proper presentation in an introductory website, you have an opportunity to spark the curiosity of potential clients. On many occasions when I have only a moment to introduce myself, I have given a business card with my website and received replies to my online introduction.
         Do you currently have an introductory site?
        </h3>

        an electronic business card. Its purpose is not to sell product but to introduce their

        Website size. These mini-websites are designed to ‘get the attention’ of you potential customers. Within the website there are plenty of opportunities for your customers to link to your main website. Brevity is often the key to getting someone’s attention. It is a lot like reading a resume, if a resume is more than a couple of pages long, they are often set aside and ignored.

As you hand your new “Get To Know You” business card include an invitation to visit the site on the back of the card. This is your opportunity to extend the short encounter to share more information about your services.
