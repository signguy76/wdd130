                <p class="how-text"><b>How it works.</b> Use this to get the attention of your 
                    customers. With a few well-placed graphics and select verbiage, you can 
                    prompt them to look deeper into your services. All too often when we have 
                    a brief encounter with a new contact, the time is too short to make a 
                    formal introduction. Sometimes there is just enough time to hand off a card. 
                    As you hand your new “Get To Know You” business card it includes an invitation 
                    to visit the site on the back of the card. This is your opportunity to extend 
                    the short encounter to share more information about your services.

                    handing your business card to your potential customers. A properly designed

                    business card. Your card will have the URL information to find you and will be
